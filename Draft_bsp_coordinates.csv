Workspace including incubators, accelerators and co working spaces, artist’s studio, and maker spaces, play an important role in the continued success of the London’s economy. However, many workspaces providers are facing financial difficulties due to high cost of business rates.  This has an adverse impact in the ability of the sector in ensuring the businesses, particularly micro businesses and start ups are able to find and secure affordable workspaces.

Following a research commissioned by the London Enterprise Action Partnership (LEAP), into the impact of the 2016/2017 business rates revaluation on co workings paces, the London Growth Hub has commissioned workshops and networking events that will be delivered by the London Business Partnership. The workshops will focus on:

    Business rates and how they are calculated
    Business rate relief and the eligibility criteria
    Best practice when applying for business rate relief

The workshops offer a fantastic opportunity for workspace providers to meet with local authorities to discuss how they can work together to simplify the process of applying for business rate relief. They are scheduled to take place across London – please click here for list of areas where the workshops will be held and how to register.

It helps UK companies selling abroad by sharing the financial risks of selling overseas, with support such as insurance and credit guarantees for their banks. It can also guarantee loans to overseas buyers of UK exports, or it can lend directly to buyers.

UKEF can support exports of goods, services and of intangibles (including intellectual property) to more than 200 countries worldwide. It can support anything from small shipments of cheese to multi-billion pound contracts to build skyscrapers or launch satellites.

It never competes with banks or insurance brokers, but steps in where needed, for example, where insurance cover to a particular destination is considered too risky due to political events. Help is available for firms of all sizes to access the finance and insurance needed to realise their export ambitions where banks and insurers are unable to help.

UKEF provides guidance to help companies access finance and to identify, manage and minimise the financial risks of exporting. It facilitates finance and bonds by providing guarantees to banks to reduce the risk of providing working capital loans and contract bonds for their customers selling abroad. It also protects exporters with insurance against non-payment by overseas buyers and against contract bonds being called unfairly or for political reasons.

Finally, it guarantees or provides loans to overseas buyers to finance the purchase of goods or services from UK exporters.
